## Remote Executive Assistants Wanted

Are you a natural when it comes to coordinating schedules, managing tasks, and researching information?
Do your friends count on you to keep their lives in order (and organize the coolest parties)?
Then you may be just who we're looking for!

As a fully remote Executive Assistant, you'll use your skills to assist elite clients like CEOs, Executives, and highly skilled professionals with a variety of responsibilities.

You can expect every day to let you explore an entirely new subject and expand your knowledge.

In the simplest terms, your job will consist of helping high-level clients make decisions – from small, everyday choices to major business dilemmas.
To make it happen, you'll be researching information, coordinating events, and creating clear, concise summaries of the results of your work.

You’ll quickly become an expert in areas you didn’t even know existed and gain a unique insight into both private and professional lives of exceptionally successful people.
Before you start handling tasks on your own, you will get all the necessary support and resources to learn how to provide the exceptional quality of services we are proud to be known for.

**What kind of requests might you actually get on the job?**

- Recommending a high-quality digital camera with advanced features like 4K video recording and image stabilization
- Organizing a photoshoot with a local photographer in Thailand
- Evaluating multi-currency debit card providers with invoice tracking capabilities for streamlined expense management at a mid-sized company
- Arranging the production of a custom-made baseball cap that can have different logos attached to it with velcro depending on the occasion
- Managing a CEO’s calendar during a business trip, or so-called Calendar Tetris (organizing meetings, locations, conference rooms, flights, visas, airport transfers, hotels, meals, power socket adapters…)
- Complex organization of a trip for a family with children to Asia (handling flights, house rentals, international school contracts, and all sorts of formalities)
- Organizing a two-day retreat for a fully remote company with employees spread over different countries

If getting paid for learning new things every day sounds fun... You'll also enjoy learning more practical details about this opening to join us as a **Remote Executive Assistant** :)

**What do you need to join us?**

- Good command of English and excellent communication skills
- Basic familiarity with Google Spreadsheets
- Openness to learning new things
- Proactive approach
- Empathy and persistence
- Reliability and attention to detail

**How do we work?**

- We are 100% remote
- We work asynchronously and don't have fixed working hours.
  Both early birds and night owls will feel comfortable, and you can do the job from whichever timezone
- We work full-time or 6h/day.
  There is plenty of work and a healthy demand for our services on the market, but we protect our staff from overload
- Combining this job with other employment is fine, but only temporarily, during the evaluation period.
  We've found it to be unsustainable in the long term
- There are no common office hours for everyone.
  We work at the time of our choosing, tracking our hours using a tool called Hubstaff
- We collaborate on the basis of a B2B contract or a contract of mandate (for residents of Poland)
- So far, most of our team members are Polish, but our work and resources are in English

For the most part we work independently, but we can always count on our teammates to brainstorm ideas together or bounce our research results off each other. On the other hand, we carry out many projects together, combining our strengths, preferences and talents for the best possible results. We discuss emerging difficulties with each other on an ongoing basis and share our experiences.

Every quarter, we all have an online "Bring Your Own Something" meeting where we talk about current projects and plans, as well as share our ideas and inspirations. Thanks to the group decision-making framework, each team member can be sure that his or her opinion will be heard and valued.

**How much can you earn?**

We generally pay **40-65 PLN** (Intermediate rate) per hour and **65-85 PLN** (Senior rate) per hour (plus VAT if necessary), but we're happy to talk even if your rate is higher than that.
Please share your expectations with us in the [application form](https://forms.gle/Cxw6B3ZPknvJfJHz9) and let's see if we can work something out.

We usually adjust the hourly rates once a year.

**Who are we and would you enjoy working with us?**

We're always doing our best to not only improve our clients' lives, but also make sure we're continuously creating a healthy and enjoyable work environment.

We see work-life balance as essential... and we really like working in good company.
Our team is currently powered almost exclusively by women (84.6%), but everyone is welcome.

We all have different passions and love sharing them with each other.
Some of our most represented interests include travel, pets, collecting LEGO, horse riding, ice skating, dancing and pilates.
We also have major plant growers and film fans among us.
;)

We are beautifully and respectfully different from each other and know how to talk about these differences in a peaceful way.
We work with a human-centered approach - we see each other as important and cultivate a culture of speaking up, giving (wanted) feedback, and building an atmosphere without unnecessary tension.

There’s one thing we all agree on:
the client's satisfaction is at the core of our work.
We genuinely want to take a major burden off their shoulders, and we are constantly striving to do it even better.
So far, we've been getting great feedback.
It feels really nice when someone trusts you with a major part of their life.

**Let’s do this!**
