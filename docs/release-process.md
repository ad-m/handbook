A couple of things worth remembering when releasing a major chunk of software:

- a deeper integration with the person responsible for emails
- tooling for emails (export to klaviyo or something)
- pre-registration for the social media buzz thing, where you can sign up to be notified about release
- a couple of weeks blocked off in the schedule just in case for adjusting stuff after release even after a good round of testing
- if the product is all about performance then automate the performance tests early on
- pre-production release with fixtures is a good idea
